<p>Remember to <b>never run untrusted</b> programs!

<p>For Bitcoin builds please do check several sources, <b>demand a PGP signature</b> made by people you trust.</p>
<p>Check scripts before running them. Check git revision before building from source and running (how ever SHA1 revisions can be spoofed, safer to also save copy of the data, check SHA256 of all files).</p>
